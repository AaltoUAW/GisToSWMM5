# GisToSWMM5

GisToSWMM5 is a tool for automatically constructing SWMM5 model descriptions. The input files for the tool can be prepared using GIS software and the resulting SWMM model can be studied in GIS. The tool takes the digital elevation model, land-use, and flow direction information from the user-prepared input files, creates subcatchments for the studied area, and routes the water between subcatchments and into the stormwater network.

The tool was originally developed by Lassi Warsta (lassi@warsta.net) at Aalto University School of Engineering and is distributed under MIT-license.

When using the GisToSWMM5 tool, please refer to the following publication:

### Using GisToSWMM5

GisToSWMM5 is easiest to use with a script where the input files are described. An example script is given in [run_scripts](run_scripts) folder. The script file should consist of the following lines, which are the inputs to the GisToSWMM5:

[PATH TO GisToSWMM5 EXECUTABLE] \  
[PATH TO DEM RASTER IN .asc FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO FLOW DIRECTION RASTER IN .asc FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO LANDUSE RASTER IN .asc FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO CATCHMENT PROPERTIES TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO JUNCTIONS TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO CONDUITS TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO OUTFALLS TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO HEADER TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO EVAPORATION TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO TEMPERATURE TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO SNOWPACK TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO RAINGAGE TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO INFLOW TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO TIMESERIES TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO PUMP TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO PUMP CURVE TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO STORAGE TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO DWF TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO PATTERNS TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO LOSSES TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO CROSSECTIONS TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO REPORT TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO SYMBOLS TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]  

GisToSWMM5 can be used to build a SWMM5 description in three modes:
1. each raster cell is an individual sub-catchment
2. cells with the same land-use and same eventual outlet are merged into one sub-catchment
3. (*legacy mode:* neighboring *2<sup>N</sup>* x *2<sup>N</sup>* cells, where *N* = 1, 2, 3, ..., are merged together into one sub-catchment if the cells have the same landuse)

In case option 1 used, the run script is as above.  
In case  option 2 is used, an additional line an integer number is required as the last line of the script:  
[*OPTIONAL* INTEGER VALUE]   
In case option 3 is used, the maximum grid cell size and the allowed number of subdivisions (*N*) are required as the two last lines of the script:  
[*OPTIONAL* MAXIMUM GRID CELL SIDE LENGTH] \  
[*OPTIONAL* NUMBER OF SUBDIVISIONS FOR GRID CELLS]  

DEM, land-use, and flow direction rasters have to be defined with the same grid. The cell size of these grids defines the minimum size of the final sub-catchment grid size. Flow direction raster uses notation where flow directions are marked with numbers from 1-8 so that 1 corresponds to flow to Northeast and numbers increase in counterclockwise direction. More information regarding the required input files is given in [input_files.md](input_files.md) and some (partly outdated) details are also available from:

### Output files

GisToSWMM5 produces the following output files:
- a SWMM input file that can be used to run  SWMM simulations  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME].inp)
- a vector file defining the sub-catchments according to mode 1  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m.wkt, where *L* is the side length of the cells in DEM, land-use, and flow direction rasters)
- a vector file defining the routing between sub-catchments according to mode 1  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m_routing.wkt)
- a vector file defining the sub-catchments (according to mode 1) that are actually routed into the catchment outfall  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m_routed.wkt)
- a vector file defining the routing of the storm-water network  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_network_routing.wkt)

When GisToSWMM5 is used to create adaptive sub-catchments in mode 2, two additional files are created:
- a raster file defining the adaptive subcatchments  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments.asc)
- a vector file defining the attributes of the adaptive subcatchments  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_attr.wkt)

The vector files are created using the Well Known Text (wkt) vector format. E.g. QGIS can natively understand .wkt-files. For conversion to shapefiles using e.g. ogr2ogr command line operation, a .csvt file defining the field types of .wkt file is created. The produced vector files allow for easily studying the SWMM model using a GIS software removing the need of using SWMM GUI.

The "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m.wkt" file has the
following attributes:  
"id;";  
"wkt;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Polygon defining the shape of the  sub-catchment  
"name;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Name of the  sub-catchment  
"outlet;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Name of node or another sub-catchment that receives runoff  
"area_m2;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Area of sub-catchment (m2)  
"slope_pct;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Average surface slope (%)  
"elevation;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Elevation of the sub-catchment  
"landuse;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Code for land-use type  
"imp_pct;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Percent of impervious area (%)  
"n_imp;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Manning's N for impervious area (-)  
"n_per;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Manning's N for pervious area (-)  
"S_imp_mm;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Depth of depression storage on impervious area (mm)  
"S_per_mm;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Depth of depression storage on pervious area (mm)  
"suct_mm;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Soil capillary suction head (mm)  
"Ksat_mmhr;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (mm/hr)  
"IMDmax;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Difference between soil porosity and initial moisture content (a fraction)  
"isSink";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// An indicator showing if the cell is a local sink/pit in the catchment  

The "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m_routing.wkt" and the "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m_routed.wkt" files have the following attributes:  
"id;";  
"wkt;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Line object defining the route between "from" and "to" subcatchments  
"from;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Name of the origin subcatchment  
"to";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Name of the target subcatchment  

The "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_network_routing.wkt" file has the following attributes:  
"id;";  
"wkt;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Line object defining the route between "from" and "to" subcatchments  
"name";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Name of the conduit  
"from;";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Name of the origin junction  
"to";&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;// Name of the target junction  

The "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments.asc" file has an integer in each raster cell indicating the corresponding catchment for the cell. If the cell does not belong to cacthment -1 is used.   

The format of "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_attr.wkt" file is equal to "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m.wkt". The only difference is that "wkt" represents only the cell at the sub-catchment center-of-mass-point, and not the entire sub-catchment. The attribute "id" corresponds to the integer value of sub-catchment in "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments.asc".

### Utility tools
Folder 'utils' contains utility programs for various tasks:
- *ExtractDataSets.py* collates time series data from (several) SWMM5 report file(s) into a single .csv file.
- *ExtractSubcatchmentResults.py* extracts subcatchment runoff summary results from the SWMM report file (.rpt) and presents them as subcatchment attributes in a shapefile.
- *wkt2shp.sh* converts the .wkt files into shapefiles (e.g. for ArcMap).
- *inp2gis.py* extracts subcatchment polygons and routing between subcatchments from a SWMM input file (\*.inp). The tool saves the subcatchments as a polygon shapefile and the routing between
the subcatchment polygon centroids as a line shapefile.
- *asc2shp.py* converts ARC/INFO ASCII GRID (.asc) raster file to polygon shapefile.
- *adap2gis.sh* creates a shapefile of adaptive sub-catchments with subcatchment attributes using the *asc2shp.py* tool and information from "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments.asc" and "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_attr.wkt" files. Note that for large catchments this may be very slow operation and the same result is probably achieved quicker by doing the corresponding operations manually in GIS-software. 

The utility tools are written in python 3.\* and bash. They have been tested on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS. The python scripts use the following non-standard libraries:
- osgeo (asc2shp.py)
- pandas (ExtractDataSets.py, ExtractSubcatchmentResults.py, inp2gis.py)
- geopandas (inp2gis.py)
- shapely (inp2gis.py)

Example run scripts for GisToSWMM5 and for *ExtractDataSets.py* and *ExtractSubcatchmentResults.py* are given in [run_scripts](run_scripts) folder.
